          I hope you're doing well ! I've really enjoyed getting to know you,
          and I was wondering if you'd be interested in going out sometime.
          Maybe we could grab a coffee or catch a movie together?
          <br />
          Let me know what you thinkâ€”I'd love to spend some time with you.
          <!-- <br /> -->
          Looking forward to hearing from you!
